# VellumFE Highlight Configuration
# This file contains all highlight patterns
# Editable via .addhl/.highlights commands

# Test highlight - should be very visible
[test_obvious]
pattern = "Obvious"
fg = "#00ff00"
bg = "#ff0000"
bold = true
fast_parse = true
category = "Testing"

# Exits highlight
[exits]
pattern = "exits:"
fg = "#00ffff"
bold = true
fast_parse = true
category = "Room"

# Example highlights - customize these for your gameplay
[friends]
pattern = "Mandrill|Monolis|Chiora|Exdeo|Kawhi|Aldhelm"
fg = "#ff00ff"
bold = true
fast_parse = true
category = "Players"

[enemies]
pattern = "Sihtric|Ehria|Ayvain|Deddalus|Daluthas"
fg = "#ffffff"
bg = "#8b0000"
bold = true
fast_parse = true
category = "Players"

# ===== SQUELCH PATTERNS (Ignore/Filter Lines) =====
# These patterns will completely hide matching lines from view.
# Use squelch = true to enable filtering for a pattern.
# Global toggle: ignores_enabled in config (or .toggleignores command)

# Squelch ambient/environmental spam
[ambient_spam]
pattern = "A cool breeze|The wind blows|A leaf falls|rustles softly"
fast_parse = true
squelch = true
category = "Squelch"

# Squelch arrival/departure spam (adjust as needed)
[arrival_spam]
pattern = "^[A-Z][a-z]+ (arrives|departs|went|comes|goes)"
squelch = true
category = "Squelch"

# Squelch energy recovery messages
[energy_spam]
pattern = "^You feel fully energized again\\.$"
squelch = true
category = "Squelch"

# ===== STREAM-FILTERED HIGHLIGHTS =====
# These highlights only apply to specific streams (e.g., death, thoughts)
# Use stream = "death" to filter by stream name

# Compact death feed - extract just player names from death messages (death stream only)
[compact_death_basic]
pattern = '^\s*\*\s*([A-Z][a-z]+) was just struck down.*'
stream = "death"
replace = "$1"
fg = "#ff4444"
bold = true
category = "Death"

# Compact death - Phoenix resurrection variant (death stream only)
[compact_death_phoenix]
pattern = '^\s*\*\s*A fiery phoenix soars into the heavens as\s*([A-Z][a-z]+).*'
stream = "death"
replace = "$1 🔥"
fg = "#ff8800"
bold = true
category = "Death"

# ===== CAPTURE GROUP EXAMPLES (Any Stream) =====
# These demonstrate $1, $2 capture group replacement without stream filtering

# Extract damage numbers from combat messages
[combat_damage]
pattern = '\b(\d+) damage\b'
fg = "#ff0000"
bold = true
category = "Combat"

# ===== WINDOW-SPECIFIC REPLACEMENTS =====
# Use window = "window_name" to apply replacements only in a specific window.
# Colors still apply everywhere, but the replacement text is window-specific.
# This allows showing different text in different windows from the same stream.
#
# Example: Compact death messages only in the "deaths" window, while main shows full text
#
# [deaths_compact]
# pattern = '^\s*\*\s*([A-Z][a-z]+) was just struck down.*'
# window = "deaths"       # Only apply replacement in this window
# stream = "death"        # Can combine with stream filter
# replace = "$1"
# fg = "#ff4444"
# category = "Death"

# ===== SILENT PROMPT PATTERNS =====
# Use silent_prompt = true to suppress the game prompt when a line matches.
# The prompt is only suppressed if the ENTIRE line is covered by silent_prompt patterns.
# Useful for movement messages or other routine output where prompts are redundant.
#
# Note: The line itself still displays - only the trailing prompt is hidden.
# If multiple lines appear between prompts and ANY line doesn't match, the prompt shows.
#
# Example - hide prompts after standard movement:
# [movement_silent]
# pattern = "^You (go|walk|run|climb|swim) "
# silent_prompt = true
# category = "Movement"
#
# Example - with color (gray out movement + suppress prompt):
# [movement_quiet]
# pattern = "^\\[.+\\]$"
# fg = "#808080"
# silent_prompt = true
# category = "Movement"
