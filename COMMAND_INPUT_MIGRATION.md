# Command Input Migration - Complete

## Summary
Successfully migrated command_input from separate `CommandInputConfig` struct to `WindowDef` like all other windows. Command input is now fully integrated with the window system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Layout Migration (src/config.rs)
- Added auto-migration in `load_from_file()` to ensure command_input exists in windows array
- If layout doesn't have command_input as WindowDef, automatically adds it from `default_windows()`
- Maintains backwards compatibility with old `[command_input]` section

### 2. Window Editor Integration (src/ui/window_editor_v2.rs)
- Added "command_input" to available_widget_types dropdown
- Users can now create command_input windows via window editor

### 3. Mouse Operations (src/app.rs)
- Added command_input to `window_layouts` HashMap in both render locations
- Command input now participates in mouse hit detection
- Move/resize operations now work on command_input
- Respects .lockwindows/.unlockwindows

### 4. Immediate Updates (src/app.rs)
- Window editor save now updates:
  - Windows array (command_input WindowDef)
  - Legacy command_input field (backwards compatibility)
  - Actual CommandInput widget (border, title, background)
- Changes apply immediately without restart

## Fixed Issues

✓ Command input now appears in `.windows` list
✓ Command input shows in window editor dropdown
✓ Mouse move/resize operations work
✓ `.lockwindows` / `.unlockwindows` work
✓ `.deletewindow command_input` is blocked
✓ Duplicate command_input creation is blocked
✓ `.editinput` works
✓ Changes apply immediately (no restart needed)
✓ Layout save/load works
✓ `.baseline` / `.resize` proportional resizing works

## Backwards Compatibility

- Old layouts without command_input in windows array are auto-migrated on load
- Legacy `[command_input]` section still maintained for older code paths
- Fallback logic ensures app works even if migration fails

## Next Steps

After extensive testing and user verification:
1. Remove `CommandInputConfig` struct entirely
2. Remove `command_input` field from `Layout` struct
3. Remove all fallback/migration code
4. Clean up any remaining references to legacy system
